The majority of the football supporters in India have been accustomed to watching European football since the late 1990s on television. The football lovers supporting the foreign clubs in the country have not gone unnoticed and the top clubs take an interest in investing time and money to connect with the fans in the country.

While there has been an increase in football lovers in India, the quality of the football played in the country still isn't close to being compared to that of their European counterparts. Bangalore, a southern city in India, was craving for a football club where a fan can connect with the club.

When Bengaluru FC (BFC) was founded on July 20, 2013, there were mixed emotions among the football lovers in Bangalore. The other clubs - that includes the likes of KGF Academy, HAL and South United FC - which were founded in the city before them had failed to draw a larger audience and even connect with their fans.

The manner in which a football club in run India is nothing like that of European clubs. A section of football supporters in the city believed Bengaluru FC would take a similar approach.

However, in the last four years Bengaluru FC and their fans have changed the way football is played and packaged in India. They won the league in their debut season and have taken their overall tally to two league titles since 2013.

Bengaluru FC played their home matches at the Bangalore Football Stadium in the first season. From the second season onwards, the home games were played at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, which is widely known as 'The Fortress'.

When one talks about Bengaluru FC in India, it is difficult to discount their fanbase, led by the famous West Block Blues fan group. This also saw a birth of a new football fan culture in India.

In a country where cricket is considered as a religion, even that widely popular sport lacks a fan culture like the ones they have in football. One needs to understand how a fan culture became a reality in Bangalore and how that has changed the lives, yes lives, of those who have been following Bengaluru FC.

Ullas Marar, who promotes social entrepreneurship in India, started supporting the club from the time it was born. He explains how Bengaluru FC's introduction was a breath of fresh air for him.

"I always found it very hard to connect with a European club. When I heard that a new club was being formed in Bangalore, it was like the answer to my prayers because for a long time I wished there were a professional football club that was local to me, which I could go and watch every weekend," Ullas explained.

"I had no idea how the club would run and I was optimistic about the chances. I always associated with HAL with a very poorly run club. I didn't see anything in terms of fan engagement, in terms of a serious competitor. There was a very casual attitude towards the club. BFC was different."

Bengaluru FC hired former Manchester United academy graduate Ashley Westwood as their first coach. That showed their intent and the 40-year-old Englishman laid the strong foundation for their success in a short period of time.

The club sent out a clear message from the beginning that things would be different. They would not take things for granted, be it the way the club is run or how they decide to interact with the fans. Rakesh Haridas, a sports entrepreneur, says "BFC was like Tesla to Indian football".

BFC signed India captain Sunil Chhetri and he was the only marquee signing of the first season. They went on to win the title in their debut season and that drew a lot of fans. Pradyum Reddy, who was Westwood's assistant, instilled confidence in other players and that played a key role in their success.

Bengaluru FC won the league in Goa and, after the trophy celebrations, the fans welcomed the players outside the stadium. Surprisingly, the club owner and chief executive officer Parth Jindal was with the fans to give the guard of honour to the players when they were boarding the bus.

A few of the first team players were left surprised when they were handed a new contract, something that had not been the case for them in the past.

Sixteen-year-old Aryan Goel explains why Bengaluru FC means a lot to him and how his family saw his passion for the club.

"Personally, the club has done a lot for me. I celebrated my brother's birthday inside the dressing room. BFC is more than a football club for me. Also, the entire stand sang happy birthday and cut the cake in the stands," said Aryan.

Aryan's parents have also been very supportive, only after realising his passion for the sport. "The day I came back after losing the title to Mohun Bagan, I was disappointed and I had to go to the school the next day."

He and his brother's passion for the sport and, in particular, BFC, did not grab a lot of attention from his family. However, the disappointment on his face when he arrived back after watching his first match in the stadium changed things at home, for both him and his brother.

Since then, his parents allow him and his brother to watch the matches with the fellow supporters in the stadium. After the match, Aryan's parents come to pick them up from the stadium.

Aryan explains a time he used to be bullied in school. That had a massive impact on his confidence. However, sharing the stands with fellow supporters where everyone is treated equally, irrespective of class, creed, age or financial status has helped him regain his confidence.

Rakesh and Ullas also point out instances when the fans have stretched their support to outside the football stadium, in their day-to-day life. Several of their fans were helped to overcome depression, with the support of other supporters.

Bengaluru FC is indeed a special club for the football fans in the Southern Indian city and it is only going to draw a larger audience after their introduction to the Indian Super League for the upcoming season.

Former Barcelona assistant coach Albert Roca is currently managing the club and both Bengaluru FC and their fans hope that the Spaniard can help them achieve more success in the coming seasons.
