Another season comes, and it is another season that will not see us at the Fortress to back these boys that we so love, and to watch them do what they do best. It will be two years since the Fortress saw Bengaluru FC play, with West Block A in all its glory. We’ll have to wait a little longer for our turn. We will.

But in the meantime, Marco Pezzaiuoli’s boys have trophies to win, Asian slots to capture, and a whole lot of fun football to be played. The disappointment of the 2020-21 ISL season was real - as the club went through a second straight trophy-less campaign. However, we are Bengaluru FC and the only way we have known is to bounce back.

The squad has seen an overhaul this season, with a number of new signings - both Indian and overseas. However, the Indian core of the squad still remains, and if Bengaluru FC are to see success this season, we’re going to need the likes of Sunil Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Suresh Singh Wangjam to be on top of their respective games.

The skipper himself will come into the season, having been awarded the coveted Khel Ratna award, and will once again be at the forefront of the Blues attack, where he’ll be complemented by the likes of Udanta Singh, Cleiton Silva and Prince Ibara.

## New signings
### Alan Costa
The big man from Brazil will join Yrondu Musavu-King as the two foreign centre-backs in the BFC squad. Costa and King have big shoes to fill, as they look to ensure that void left by Juanan’s departure isn’t felt. The Spaniard was a rock at the back for the Blues in the last five seasons, with his contributions playing a huge part in the success the club had under Albert Roca and Carles Cuadrat.

Costa, who joined BFC on loan from Brazilian club Avai, is a lanky presence at the back, with terrific aerial prowess. Under Pezzaiuoli’s ways, it will also be important for him to be adept at carrying the ball out of the back, and ensuring the Blues’ build-up begins right from the back, instead of just hoofing it up-field.

### Bruno Ramirez
The third Brazilian in the season’s BFC squad, Ramires potentially is one of the Blues’ most important players this season. He will have to complement the role played by Suresh Wangjam in the middle of the park, and does have the tools to do so.

### Iman Basafa
The first Iranian in the history of BFC, Basafa is likely to be in contention for that midfield spot alongside Suresh, with only one of him or Ramires likely to be starting at any point of time.

Like Ramires, Basafa will have to fill the void left by the departures of Erik Paartalu and Dimas Delgado, who are both not going to be easy acts to follow.

### Prince Ibara
The big man from Congo comes in as the next in a line of potential successors to Miku, that the club has been striving to find. Manu Onwu, Deshorn Brown and Kristian Opseth all couldn’t quite fulfill the role that was needed off them. In Prince, there is another opportunity for redemption. If he comes up with the goods on a consistent basis, there’s a good chance that the Blues will be playing playoffs football once again this season.

### Jayesh Rane
Last season, Cleiton Silva was tasked both with being the creative presence in the Blues midfield, while also having to be a goal-scorer, in the absence of a prolific marksman up-front. This season, Jayesh Rane has arrived to take some of that burden of the Brazilian.

Jayesh is likely to operate as the most advanced of the Blues’ midfielder, and will have good company in the engine room, in the likes of Ramires and Suresh, who will provide the base from which Jayesh can express himself in the middle.

### Rohit Kumar
Rohit arrives at the Blues from Kerala Blasters, and is likely to only initially be a back-up to Suresh in the Blues midfield. A good engine, decent passing range, and the ability to strike a ball from distance - Rohit does have it in his game, but the big test will be to produce consistently on the pitch.

### Danish Farooq
His role will be of immense interest through the course of the ISL season. Danish made his name as an attacking player at Real Kashmir. However, in the AFC Cup, he was given the role of a deep-lying playmaker, where he was impressive at times.

He’s got a good range of passing, and the ability to manipulate the ball at his feet, so theoretically, he is suited to playing the role of the #6. However, there might be question marks over his defensive awareness and speed if he does have to play that role more consistently for Pezzaiuoli.

### Sarthak Golui
Sarthak has been signed by the Blues to fill a very important void in the squad. Rahul Bheke’s versatility was a huge part of what has him in BFC folklore at the moment (yes, THAT goal in Mumbai helps of course). With Bheke now having left for pastures new, Pezzaiuoli is likely to look at Sarthak as the man to take up the role that Bhekenbauer has left behind.

Sarthak will also be important in the sense that he offers Pezzaiuoli the flexibility to change the configuration of foreign players on the pitch. If there is a need for more foreign attackers on the pitch at any point, Sarthak is adept at playing at centre-back, which would mean that both Costa and King need not be on the pitch at the same point of time.

### Harmanpreet Singh
Unfortunately, an impressive Durand Cup ended with a season-ending injury, which means we’re unlikely to see Harmanpreet in the famous blue shirt for this season.
