The team on the pitch does its best every night to try and make our dreams come true. Us, in the stands, do our best every single time to push them to limits they knew not existed to help them make their dreams a reality. We are the obsessed, the passionate â€“ We are The West Block Blues.

Named after the colors of our club and the West Block A stand where you can find us all, the roots of our story is embedded in a small group of likeminded fans who came together to create something distinct, something powerful. 

And this role as the 12th man is taken extraordinarily seriously by each and every one of us, as we know that it is our duty to the team to be the loudest, most vociferous fans in all the land; to create an atmosphere so intimidating that the opponents never feel safe regardless of score or time.

We are constantly searching for new and innovative ways to support the club and the National Team, and have also been involved in various non-profit activities away from football as well.
Proudly, We are The West Block Blues.
